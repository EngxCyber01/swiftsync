## 💡 What "Sync Now" Does

**Think of it like this:**

🔄 **Sync Now** = **Check for new lectures button**

### Simple Explanation:
When you click "Sync Now", the system:
1. Logs into the portal (like you logging in manually)
2. Goes to your lecture page
3. Checks all 2025-2026 lectures
4. Downloads any NEW files that aren't already saved
5. Updates your dashboard with new files

### When to Use:
- ✅ Teacher just uploaded a lecture → Click to get it now
- ✅ Morning routine → Check for overnight uploads
- ✅ Before class → Make sure you have latest materials
- ✅ After weekend → Sync Monday morning
- ✅ Testing → Verify system still works

### What Happens:
```
You click button
     ↓
"Syncing..." message shows (button disabled)
     ↓
System connects to portal (takes 5-10 seconds)
     ↓
Downloads any new files
     ↓
"Downloaded X new files" message appears
     ↓
Dashboard refreshes automatically
     ↓
Button re-enables
```

### Real Example:
```
Monday 9:00 AM - Teacher uploads "OOP Lec 9.pdf"
Monday 9:30 AM - You open portal
Dashboard shows: 47 files

You click "Sync Now"
Button says: "Syncing..."
Wait 8 seconds...
Message: "✅ Downloaded 1 new file"

Dashboard now shows: 48 files
New file appears in "Object Oriented Programming" section
```
